# Newschain.cc:

Newschain.cc is a decentralized platform for publishing and discovering news articles.  

Motivated by the current state of digital media: clickbait news, consumer lack of trust and censorship.  This is a non-profit experiment to understand the opportunities that the blockchain technology brings to distribute news. 

We envision an open platform, where journalists truly own their digital publications. That is, the ability to sell a publication,  rent advertising space, as well as share its profits with their peers or audience. 

We seek a truly democratic platform.  Where the news that are -truly- relevant to the most constitute the headlines of the platform.  This means: an open algorithm for reporting and estimating an article relevance, as well as mechanisms to disencourage bot participation.    

Deployed as a protocol on a EVM-compatible blockchain.  News articles are posted as transactions and discovered by browsing events logs.
